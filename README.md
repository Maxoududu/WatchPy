WatchPy
=======

A simple python script to monitor my room using a RaspberryPi, a Webcam, PyGame and Dropbox API.

I'm using PyGame (http://www.pygame.org/) to capture images and add timecode to them and I'm uploading these images to dropbox using their CoreAPI (https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/start/python).
